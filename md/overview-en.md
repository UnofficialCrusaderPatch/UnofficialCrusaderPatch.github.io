The Unofficial Crusader Patch (UCP) is a community-driven project for Firefly Studio's classic game, **Stronghold Crusader**. It serves as a framework to apply essential bug-fixes, rebalance units, add quality-of-life improvements, and introduce new content like maps and AI opponents.

The UCP does not include any original game files from FireFly Studios. Instead, it intelligently patches your existing game installation to enhance the experience.

*The UCP3-GUI allows you to easily manage all your extensions and content with very little effort.*

### Getting Started

Installing the UCP is a simple, two-part process: first the GUI (this application), then the modding framework itself from within the GUI.

1.  **Select Game Folder:** Use the "Browse" button in the GUI to select your Stronghold Crusader installation folder. If you're on Steam, you can find the location through the Steam client.
2.  **Install Framework:** Click the "Install" button to download and set up the latest UCP framework. The GUI will handle everything.
3.  **Get Content:** Visit the **Content** and **Store** tabs to browse and activate new maps, AI, and gameplay extensions.
4.  **Launch:** Use the **Launch** tab to start your newly patched game!
