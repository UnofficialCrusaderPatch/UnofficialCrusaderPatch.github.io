### Does this work in multiplayer?
Yes, multiplayer works fine with the UCP installed as long as everyone playing has the same options selected. However, certain features such as changing Player 1's color or activating Spectator Mode will cause a crash or desync in multiplayer!

***
### What about bigger maps?
It is a lot of work to support custom map sizes without having access to the game's source code. We are determined to get bigger maps in the future, but until then, we will need more community contributions in reverse engineering the game.

***
### Can you include a new feature?
Please check our [Roadmap & Ideas page](#wiki/Project/Roadmap-Ideas) first to see what is planned. If your idea isn't there, you are welcome to get in touch on our Discord. If a developer likes the idea they may look into it, but no promises are made.

***
### I'm a programmer, how can I get involved?
You are welcome to look through the issues and find ideas you want to fix or implement. The best place to start is by joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/P9dkF38Q2t) to get in touch with the team.

***
### I'm not a programmer, how can I help?
Testers are always welcome! Let us know on Discord if you want to help test new features. You can also follow the GitHub repository to get alerts on new code submissions, see what the changes are supposed to do, and test them in-game to ensure they work as intended.

***
### Am I allowed to modify this for personal use?
Of course!

***
### Where can I get community-developed AIs?
A few are bundled with the installer, and you can find many more in the content creation channels on our Discord server.

***
### Is there a tutorial on how to make my own AIs?
